### Creative Lab :Contactless doorbell devices

##### Requirement：

Think about how these kits could be used in the environment around your home. Invent a device relevant to your daily life using the above parts. What does it help you do? What are the possible use cases for this device? What interactions does it afford the user? Design or sketch an enclosure, and include a video of the circuit working (or a tinkercad link). Feel free to be inspired by the above readings.

##### Description:

What I was made was a small contactless doorbell device. A now everyone need to keep social distance for health. And for the same reason we seldom go out for shopping. We have a lot of parcels or takeaways, which the frequency deliveryman knock on the door would increase.

So I try to improve the doorbell what we use now. And then I will put this small device on the door. I would stick a note on the door which talk deliveryman how to use it. They just need to wave his hand in front of the sensor,then they could leave. This way I can hear the buzzer or see the LED flashing and know the delivery is at the door. It reduces the possibility I miss it.SO we can avoid contacting with each other. It sounds like a doorbell we can see everywhere, but the deliveryman doesn't have to knock or touch the doorbell,which is more convenient and healthful.
