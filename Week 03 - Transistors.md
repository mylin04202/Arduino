# Week 03 - Transistors

### Lab 01: PWM

# requirement：
Today we're going to use PWM to fade an LED.

Playing with fades

- Go here and build this circuit. Try typing the code yourself: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Fade

Take a short video to submit of the working circuit, or put a link to your tinkercad project you've made public on your blog.

### Lab 02 Voltage Dividers

# requirement：
Hook up the circuit in the slides with the light dependent resistor. 

Take a short video to submit of the working circuit, or put a link to your tinkercad project you've made public on your blog.

### Lab 03: Dark detecting Circuit

# requirement：
Making a dark detecting LED (From Circuit diagram to breadboard) Build this project to better understand transistors https://makezine.com/projects/dark-detecting-led/ There is one change though, verses use a battery, we're just going to power our circuit with the Arduino 3V out.

[Here's the datasheet for the phototransistor] (https://www.avnet.com/shop/emea/products/everlight/pt333-3c-3074457345634369228?&r=EMEA&CMP=AVNET-EMEA-PPC-Google-All-English-AVE14-SKU-1699305114-66248026957-042019)

Take a short video to submit of the working circuit, or put a link to your tinkercad project you've made public on your blog. Note in Tinkercad the phototransistor here is called an Ambient Light Sensor [Phototransistor]

#### Lab 03b: Touch Sensor (KIT ONLY) 

Using the circuit in the slides, make the touch sensor.
Take a short video to submit of the working circuit and put it on your blog. 



### Lab 04: Feedback systems

# requirement：
Before doing this lab, it's important to do this week's reading, listed below. You may end up doing this lab as homework.

Systems which feedback on themselves often feel more alive to us than static systems which only output data. Design a system, based on what we have learned so far, which feedbacks on itself. How could interaction work within a system which is continually feeding back on itself?
