# Week 06 - Analog Synth Cats in Space

## Lab 01: Simple synths

### Requirement:

Try and build an analog synth. Note, the chip in the photos and diagrams is the same as the one in the video, they just change numbers depending on who makes it. Yours is the CD40106BE. 

If you have a real kit, build it, if not follow along on Tinkercad. Up to you!
